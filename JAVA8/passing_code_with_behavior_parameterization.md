# Strategy Pattern

We describe a family of algorithms, encapsulate each algorithm and select one of them at runtime.

Old way of behavior parameterization was very verbose. We had to write interfaces and their implementations. Then pass
on the behavior wrapped inside the objects of those implementation classes.

Another solution is using Anonymous Classes, but that too is verbose. As it contains a lot of code and that is confusing too.


Behavior Parameterization -> Classes (old and verbose), Anonymous Classes (old and verbose), Lambdas(which is Java 8 style and concise)
